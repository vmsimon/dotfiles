* On a fresh macOS:
	* Setup for a software development environment entirely with a one-liner ðŸ”¥
    ```
    curl --silent https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vmsimon/dotfiles/master/setup-mac-os.sh | bash
    ```

	* Open a Fish shell and execute `compile_vim_plugins` and `install_oh_my_fish` functions.
	* Enter license information of purchased applications.
	* Process Dropbox\'s Dotfiles folder if you use Dropbox.

* Execute `bootstrap` function freely which in turn executes the bootstrapping script.
